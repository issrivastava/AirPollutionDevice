Why?
Air pollution harms health, causing respiratory and heart diseases, and leads to millions of premature deaths. It damages ecosystems, accelerates climate change, and threatens biodiversity. Economically, it strains healthcare, reduces productivity, and harms crops. If left unchecked, it causes irreversible environmental and societal damage.

WHEN ?
Waiting for the "correct time" to act against air pollution and environmental degradation only accelerates destruction and extinction. The impacts are already visible, with rising global temperatures, biodiversity loss, and increasing health crises. Procrastination allows problems to grow beyond control, threatening ecosystems and humanity's future. Immediate, collective action is essential to prevent irreversible damage and secure a livable planet for future generations. The time to act is now.
